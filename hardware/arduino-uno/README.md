The ATmega328 has 32 KB (with 0.5 KB occupied by the bootloader). It also has 2
KB of SRAM and 1 KB of EEPROM.

The board can operate on an external supply from 6 to 20 volts. If supplied
with less than 7V, however, the 5V pin may supply less than five volts and the
board may become unstable. If using more than 12V, the voltage regulator may
overheat and damage the board. The recommended range is 7 to 12 volts.
